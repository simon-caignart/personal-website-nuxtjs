This suite includes a display and management software (in cinemas and at headquarters). This internship was part of the work regularly implemented to improve the existing and facilitate the work of end users. This internship focused on the display management software used in cinemas, my work therefore consisted of carrying out a project to overhaul the display management software, which is now called \"EasyCiné Display\". This software is now used in every of the 71 movie theaters of the group, and can be seen in action on the screens of the lobbies, entrances, exteriors, etc."
